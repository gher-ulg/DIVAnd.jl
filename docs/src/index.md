## Examples

To run the example, you need to install `PyPlot`.
In the folder `examples` of DIVAnd, you can run e.g. the example `DIVAnd_simple_example_1D.jl` by issuing:

```julia
# cd("/path/to/DIVAnd/examples")
include("test/DIVAnd_simple_example_1D.jl")
```

Replace `/path/to/DIVAnd/` by the installation directory of DIVAnd which is the output of the following code:

```julia
using DIVAnd;
joinpath(dirname(pathof(DIVAnd)), "..")
```


### Advection constraint

The functions `DIVAndrun`, `DIVAndgo` and `diva3d` can also use an advection constraint forcing the analysis to align with a vector field (e.g. a velocity field).
The velocity field should be a
tuple of n-elements. Every element of the tuple is a gridded array (defined at the same location than the target array) representing a single velocity component.
For 3D analysis, the order of the dimensions is typically: longitude, latitude and depth. Like-wise the velocity components are
zonal, meridional and vertical velocity. The three velocity components has to be scaled by
a constant factor to enhance or decrease this constraint. It is recommended that this parameter is tuned by cross-validation. There are no tools currently in `DIVAnd.jl` to automate this process.

For the two dimensional case, the velocity has just two components as shown in the example below.

```@example
using DIVAnd, PyPlot

# square domain in 2 dimensions from -1 to 1
mask, (pm, pn), (xi, yi) = DIVAnd_squaredom(2, range(-1, stop = 1, length = 30))

# location of the observations
x = [.4]
y = [.4]

# observed value
f = [1.]

# velocity field and its strength for the advection constrain
strength = 0.5
u = strength * yi
v = -strength * xi

# normalized obs. error variance and correlation length
epsilon2 = 1 / 200
len = 0.2

# call DIVAnd
fi, s = DIVAndrun(mask,(pm,pn),(xi,yi),(x,y),f,len,epsilon2; velocity = (u,v))

# plot the results
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(x,y,"rx")
quiver(xi,yi,u,v)
gca().set_aspect(1)
title("velocity field")

subplot(1,2,2)
plot(x,y,"rx")
pcolor(xi,yi,fi)
gca().set_aspect(1)
title("analysis")
savefig("example-advection-2d.png"); nothing # hide
```

## Performance considerations


### Tuning the domain decomposition

The functions `diva3d` and `DIVAndgo` split the domain into overlapping sub-domains to reduce the required amount of memory. In some circumstances (in particular few vertical levels), this can unnecessarily degrade the performance. The CPU time of the analysis can be improved by increasing the `diva3d` option `memtofit` from 3 (default) to higher values (as long as one does not run out of memory). If this parameter is set to a very high value then the domain decomposition is effectively disabled.

### Multiple CPU system

Per default Julia tries to use all CPUs on your system when doing matrix operations. The number of CPUs is controlled by the call to `BLAS.set_num_threads`. Using multiple CPUs can result in overhead and it can be beneficial to reduce the number of CPUs:

```julia
BLAS.set_num_threads(2)
```

## Debugging message

From Julia 1.0 on, debugging messages can be activated using the following Julia command:

```julia
ENV["JULIA_DEBUG"] = "DIVAnd"
```


See also https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Logging/index.html#Environment-variables-1 .

## Correlation length

The estimation of the correlation length in the function `diva3d` can be activated with the option
`fitcorrlen` for the horizontal and vertical correlation. The parameter `len` should then
an empty tuple (`()`) or a tuple of arrays equal to one. The actually used correlation length is a product
between the provided values of the array `len` and the estimated correlation length by fitting. Setting `fitcorrlen`
to true means thus that the interpretation of the parameters changes from absolution correlation
length to relative correlation length.

The estimation of the horizontal and vertical correlation can also be activated selectively by just setting
`fithorzcorrlen` and `fitvertcorrlen` (respectively) to true.

If one wants to not use the vertical correlation length, the one can put the corresponding value in `len` to zero.
Consequently the value of `fitvertcorrlen` and `fitcorrlen` should be keep to `false` (i.e. its default values).
Optimizing the horizontal correlation length is still possible by setting `fithorzcorrlen` to `true`.


## Integrating different datasets

To facilitated the integrating of different datasets,
the function `WorldOceanDatabase.load` from the module `PhysOcean` now supports an option `prefixid` which can be set to `"1977-"`
so that the obsids have automatically the right format for DIVAnd, e.g. `"1977-wod123456789O"`:

```julia
using PhysOcean
# assuming the data in the directory "somedir": e.g. "somedir/CTD/file.nc", "somedir/XBT/file.nc"...
basedir = "somedir"
varname = "Temperature"
prefixid = "1977-"
obsvalue,obslon,obslat,obsdepth,obstime,obsid = WorldOceanDatabase.load(Float64,
   basedir,varname; prefixid = prefixid);
```

In the module `PhysOcean`, we implemented the function ARGO.load which can load data following the ARGO format and in particular the CORA dataset.
In fact, even if CORA is distributed through CMEMS, the netCDF files in CORA do not follow the same format than the other in situ netCDF files from CMEMS.
Therefore the function `CMEMS.load` can not be used for the CORA dataset.
`ARGO.load` also supports the option prefixid.


```julia
using Glob, PhysOcean
# assuming the data in the directory "somedir": e.g. "somedir/someyear/file.nc"
filenames = glob("*/*nc","somedir")
obsvalue,obslon,obslat,obsdepth,obstime,obsids = ARGO.load(Float64,
   filenames,varname; prefixid = "4630-")
```

In divadoxml we added the new argument additionalcontacts which allows one to acknowledge other datasets which are not in the MARIS database:

```julia
using DIVAnd
additionalcontacts = [
    DIVAnd.getedmoinfo(1977,"originator"), # US NODC for World Ocean Database
    DIVAnd.getedmoinfo(4630,"originator"), # CORIOLIS for CORA
]
ignore_errors = true
DIVAnd.divadoxml(
           filename,varname,project,cdilist,xmlfilename,
           ignore_errors = ignore_errors,
           additionalcontacts = additionalcontacts
)
```

!!! note
    You will see a warning that not all observation identifiers could be found, but this is normal and expected.



## Frequently asked questions

### Which data points are used for the analysis?

An individual data point is used if all following conditions are met:
1. longitude/latitude is inside the domain and not adjacent to a land point
2. the depth is within the depth range of the domain
3. the time is within the temporal range
4. if an _anamorphosis_ transform is used, it should correspond to a finite transformed value
5. during the loading, the corresponding quality flag is among the accepted quality flags

Note that for points 1.-3. the finite precision of floating point numbers can affect the results.

### How to resolve a bias of the surface layer (or the deepest layer)?

In DIVAnd, the vertical levels must resolve the vertical correlation length. If the vertical correlation length is smaller than the
surface resolution, this can result in a bias of the surface value. A similar problem can also be present at the deepest layer.
The solution is to either refine the vertical resolution or to increase the vertical correlation length.


### How do I limit the estimated horizontal and vertical correlation length in DIVAnd?

It can be necessary to limit the estimated correlation length to an acceptable range. The function (called `limitfun`) can be
applied to the estimated correlation to make such adjustment. This function takes as arguments the estimated correlation length and the depth
and returns the adjusted correlation length. For example the following function forces the horizontal correlation length to be between 50 km
and 200 km (independently of the depth).

```julia
# len and z are expressed in meters
function mylimitfun(z,len)
   if len > 200_000
      return 200_000
   end
   if len < 50_000
      return 50_000
   end
   return len
end
```
(`200_000` is just a more readable way to write `200000`). This function is used in `diva3d` as follow:


```julia
... = diva3d(...
   fithorz_param = Dict(:limitfun => mylimitfun)
```

The same can be achieved more compactly as follows:

```julia
... = diva3d(...
   fithorz_param = Dict(:limitfun => (z,len) -> min(max(len,50_000),200_000)),
   fitvert_param = Dict(:limitfun => (z,len) -> min(max(len,20),200)))
```

A similar option has also be added for the vertical correlation length.

### How do I reduce the estimated correlation length near the coast when it is estimated internally?

The actual used correlation lengths is the product between the estimated one (by fitting) and the
arrays in the parameter `len` (if provided). The function `lengraddepth` can be used to create a reduced correlation length near the bathymetry.
(https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/blob/master/notebooks/5-AdvancedTopics/17-relative-correlation-length.ipynb)

### How can I handle data set of very different resolution?

If data from a high-resolution dataset (e.g. profiling float, dense time series) is
combined with data with a low spatial resolution (e.g. profiles from a research
vessel), then the analysis can be biased toward the high-resolution data. The function `weight_RtimesOne(x,len)` can be used to reduce the weight of the high-resolution data (https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/blob/master/notebooks/13-processing-parameter-optimization.ipynb). Alternative methods are averaging data in bins ("binning") or simply sub-sampling the data.

### My parameter represent a concentration and I get unrealistic negative values


* You can use an anamorphosis transform, in particular `DIVAnd.Anam.loglin`. The idea is that the transformed variable is closer to a Gaussian distribution that the original variable.
* Use the option `fieldmin = 0.0` of `diva3d`

If the parameter `epsilon` of `DIVAnd.Anam.loglin` is larger than zero (which is necessary if some measurements are exactly zero), then the smallest value that analysis can have is `-epsilon`. Therefore the option `fieldmin` is still required to avoid negative values.


### How can I speed up analysis using observations which always have the same coordinates?

In this situation, the measurements are always done at the same locations, but the measurements are repeated over time or different variables are measured at those positions. It is possible to take into the already computed matrices so that the subsequent analysis can be executed much faster.

Let's assume the observations are available on `np` locations and repeated `nt` times, so that `obsval` is an array of size `np X nt`.

The first analysis is performed using:
```julia
@time fi1,s = DIVAndrun((mask),(pm,pn),
    (xi,yi),(obslon,obslat),Float64.(obsval[:,1]),len,epsilon2);
```
then, for the `nt` other analysis, we use the structure `s`, computed in the previous step, as follows:
```julia
fpi = s.P * (s.H' * (s.R \ obsval[:,i]))
f_with_mask = unpack(s.sv, fpi, NaN)
```
where i=1, ..., nt.

The `unpack` function _unpacks_ the vector `fpi` into the different variables var1, var2, ... `s.sv` is the statevector and `NaN` is the fill value.

Check the [example](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVAnd.jl/blob/master/examples/DIVAnd_example_fixed_obs.jl).

## API changes

We do our best to avoid changing the API, but sometimes it is unfortunately necessary.

* 2021-04-21: When using domain splitting, the average correlation length is computed over all domain and not per subdomain. The API remained the same.
* 2019-06-24: `DIVAnd.fit_isotropic` and `DIVAnd.fit` are removed and replaced by `DIVAnd.fithorzlen` and `DIVAnd.fitvertlen`.
* 2019-06-24: If the parameters `background_lenz` and `background_lenz_factor` of `diva3d` are both specified, then preference will now be given for `background_lenz`.
* 2018-07-02: The module `divand` has been renamed `DIVAnd` and likewise functions containing `divand`
* 2018-06-18: The options `nmean` and `distbin` of `fithorzlen` and `fitvertlen` have been removed. The functions now choose appropriate values for these parameters automatically.



## Information for developers

To update the documentation locally, install the package `Documenter` and run the script `include("docs/make.jl")`.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Documenter")
```



## Troubleshooting


If the installation of a package fails, it is recommended to update the local copy of the package list by issuing `Pkg.update()` to make sure that Julia knows about the latest version of these packages and then to re-try the installation of the problematic package.
For example to retry the installation of `EzXML` issue the following command:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.update()
Pkg.add("EzXML")
```


### Installation problem of PyPlot on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

Make sure that the following Debian/Ubuntu packages are installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 libpython3 python3-tk
```

Then start Julia and run:

```
using Pkg
Pkg.build("PyCall")
Pkg.build("PyPlot")
```

Test PyPlot with:

```julia
using PyPlot
plot(1:10)
```


### No plotting window appears

If the following command doesn't produce any figure
```julia
using PyPlot
plot(1:10)
```
A possible solution is to modify the *backend*: this is done by editing the python configuration file
[matplotlibrc](http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html#the-matplotlibrc-file). The location of this file is obtained in python with:

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.matplotlib_fname
```

Under Linux, this returns ```'~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc'```.
To use the `TkAgg` backend, add the following to the file:

```
backend      : TkAgg
```

The `matplotlibrc` need to be created if it does not exists.

### C runtime library when calling PyPlot

`R6034 an application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly` on Windows 10 with julia 0.6.1, matplotlib 2.1.0, PyPlot 2.3.2:

```julia
ENV["MPLBACKEND"]="qt4agg"
```
You can put this line in a file `.juliarc.jl` placed in your home directory (the output of `homedir()` in Julia).

### Julia cannot connect to GitHub on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012

Cloning the package registery or downloading a Julia packages fails with:

```
GitError(Code:ECERTIFICATE, Class:OS, , user cancelled certificate checks: )
```

The problem is that Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012 uses outdated encryption protocols. The solution is to run the
"Easy fix" tool from the [Microsoft support page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49065986/installation-of-julia-on-windows7-64-bit)

### MbedTLS.jl does not install on Windows 7


The installation of `MbedTLS.jl` fails with the error message:

```
INFO: Building MbedTLS
Info: Downloading https://github.com/quinnj/MbedTLSBuilder/releases/download/v0.6/MbedTLS.x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz to C:\Users\Jeremy\.julia\v0.6\MbedTLS

```

See also the issue <https://github.com/JuliaWeb/MbedTLS.jl/issues/133>.

The solution is to install the [Windows Management Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855).

### EzXML.jl cannot be installed on RedHat 6

The `zlib` library of RedHat 6, is slightly older than the library which `EzXML.jl` and `libxml2` requires.

To verify this issue, you can type in Julia

```
using Libdl
using Pkg
Libdl.dlopen(joinpath(Pkg.dir("EzXML"),"deps/usr/lib/libxml2.so"))
```

It should not return an error message. On Redhat 6.6, the following error message is returned:

```
ERROR: could not load library "/home/username/.../EzXML/deps/usr/lib/libxml2.so"

/lib64/libz.so.1: version `ZLIB_1.2.3.3' not found (required by /home/.../EzXML/deps/usr/lib/libxml2.so)

Stacktrace:

 [1] dlopen(::String, ::UInt32) at ./libdl.jl:97 (repeats 2 times)
```

A newer version `zlib` can be installed by the following command:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("CodecZlib")
```

However, the following command should work:

```julia
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.julia/full/path/to/CodecZlib/.../deps/usr/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" julia --eval  'print(Libdl.dlopen(joinpath(Pkg.dir("EzXML"),"deps/usr/lib/libxml2.so"))'
```

by replacing the file path appropriately.
(see also <https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/7004>, <https://github.com/JuliaIO/HDF5.jl/issues/97>, and <https://github.com/bicycle1885/EzXML.jl/issues/102>)

To make Julia use this library, a user on RedHat 6 should always start Julia with:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.julia/full/path/to/CodecZlib/.../deps/usr/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" julia
```

One can also create script with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.julia/full/path/to/CodecZlib/.../deps/usr/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
exec /path/to/bin/julia "$@"
```

by replacing `/path/to/bin/julia` to the full path of your installation directory.
The script should be marked executable and it can be included in your Linux search [`PATH` environment variable](http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html). Julia can then be started by calling directly this script.



### The DIVAnd test suite fails with `automatic download failed`

Running `using Pkg; Pkg.test("DIVAnd")` fails with the error:

```julia
automatic download failed (error: 2147500036)
```

The test suite will download some sample data. You need to have internet access and run the test function from a directory with write access.

You can change the directory to your home directory with the Julia command `cd(homedir())`.

You can check the current working directory with:

```julia
pwd()
```

### Convert error in `DIVAnd_obs`

The full error message:

```
MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type DIVAnd.DIVAnd_constrain{Float32,Diagonal{Float64},SparseMatrixCSC{Float64,Int64}} to an object of type DIVAnd.DIVAnd_constrain{Float64,TR,TH} where TH<:(AbstractArray{#s370,2} where #s370<:Number) where TR<:(AbstractArray{#s371,2} where #s371<:Number)
This may have arisen from a call to the constructor DIVAnd.DIVAnd_constrain{Float64,TR,TH} where TH<:(AbstractArray{#s370,2} where #s370<:Number) where TR<:(AbstractArray{#s371,2} where #s371<:Number)(...),
since type constructors fall back to convert methods.
```

The solution is to use the same type of all input parameters: all Float32 or all Float64.

### Monthlist issue

Using comments inside list can lead to unexpected results.

This

```julia
 monthlist = [
       [1,2,3]
       #[4,5,6]
       ]
```

should be written as

```julia
 monthlist = [
       [1,2,3]
       ]
```

### Error in the factorisation

The error message `Base.LinAlg.PosDefException(95650)`
followed by the stack-trace below might be due to a wrong choice in the analysis parameters, for example a too long correlation length.

```
Stacktrace:
 [1] #cholfact!#8(::Float64, ::Function, ::Base.SparseArrays.CHOLMOD.Factor{Float64}, ::Base.SparseArrays.CHOLMOD.Sparse{Float64}) at ./sparse/cholmod.jl:1360
 .................

```

### DimensionMismatch when running `diva3d`

You get an error like
```julia
DimensionMismatch("tried to assign 201×201 array to 202×201 destination")
```

This type of error might be due to the reading of the bathymetry: if you work with a
regional bathymetry (for instance not with GEBCO), you should set the option
`bathisglobal` to false.

When `bathisglobal = true`, the longitude is supposed to *wrap around*
(the last element of the lon should be right before the first element of lon),
thus the dimension mismatch.


### Installing additional packages when using a git clone

If `DIVAnd` is installed without the package manager, it can be necessary
to install additional packages. This will be explicitly shown,
for example:

```
LoadError: ArgumentError: Module Roots not found in current path.
Run `Pkg.add("Roots")` to install the Roots package.
```

### Kernel not working with IJulia/Jupyter under Julia 0.7 Windows

Try these commands

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ZMQ")
Pkg.add("IJulia")
Pkg.update()
```
