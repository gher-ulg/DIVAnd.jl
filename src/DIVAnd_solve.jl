Solve the variational problem.

     fi = DIVAnd_solve(s)

Derive the analysis based on all contraints included in s and using the
observations yo

Input:
  s: structure created by DIVAnd_factorize
  fi0: starting point for iterative primal methods
  f0: starting point for the iterative dual method

  btrunc: the value at which the stored value of s.iB was truncated and needs to be completed on the fly using jmBix

Output:
  fi: analyzed field
