    iB = DIVAnd_background_components(s,D,alpha; kwargs...)

Form the different components of the background error covariance matrix.
Compute the components of the background error covariance matrix `s.iB_` and
their sum based on alpha (the adimensional coefficients for norm, gradient,
laplacian,...).

If the optional arguments contains btrunc, the calculation of iB is limited
to the term up and including alpha[btrunc]
