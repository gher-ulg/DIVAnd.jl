Form the inverse of the background error covariance matrix.
s = DIVAnd_background(mask,pmn,Labs,alpha,moddim)
Form the inverse of the background error covariance matrix with
finite-difference operators on a curvilinear grid
# Input:
* mask: binary mask delimiting the domain. 1 is inside and 0 outside.
        For oceanographic applications, this is the land-sea mask.
* pmn: scale factor of the grid.
* Labs: correlation length
* alpha: dimensional coefficients for norm, gradient, laplacian,...
     alpha is usually [1,2,1] in 2 dimensions.
# Output:
*  s: structure containing
    * s.iB: inverse of the background error covariance
    * s.L: spatially averaged correlation length
    * s.n: number of dimensions
    * s.coeff: scaling coefficient such that the background variance diag(inv(iB)) is one far away from the boundary.
