Computes superobservations to reduce the number of observation point.
IMPORTANT: assumes all points are located in the domain of interest.
Also, if topology (not taken into account in the present version) is complicated, a superobs could fall on land.
In that case possible solution: take as coordinates those of the closest real observation (in water).
Also consider that when using superobs for heatmap calculations, the automatic calculation of bandwidth can become too optimistic (and yield to small bandwidth).

newx,newval,sumw,varp,idx=DIVAnd_superobs(x,val,nmax;weights=[],intensive=true)

# Input:
* `x`   : tuple of coordinates of the original observations
* `val` : array which contains the values of the observation
* `nmax`: approximate number of superobservations to calculate (real number will depend on distribution in space)
* `weights` : array of weight used to calculate weighted averages (including when calculating positions of the superobs)
*               Default is unit weights.
* `intensive` : boolean which when true (default) calculates the average of values, otherwise the sum

# Output:
* `newx` : tuple of coordinates of the new super observations
* `newval`: array of values of the new super observations
* `sumw`: array containing for each superobservation value the sum of weights that where involved. Can be used for defining weight of superobservation
* `varp`: array of variance (variance around the mean defining the new super observation). Can be used for defining weight of superobservation
* `idx` : array containing the inverse of grid spacing (one in each direction) that were used for the binning

Normal use with default values creates classical superobservations

Alternative use to prepare heatmaps:

    newx,newinflation,sumw,varp=DIVAnd_superobs(x,ones(size(inflation)),nmax;weights=inflation,intensive=false)

creates a new inflation array by summing up the inflation from the points involved in the superobservation calculation.
For the moment in this case sumw, varp are not meaningful. TODO: include in varp the variance on POSITIONS so that for headmaps it can be taken into acount for adaptive length scales
